# Tidyverse in packages

* How to refer to functions (recap)
* Tidy evaluation
  * Data masking
  * Tidy select
* Data in packages

Draws heavily on <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html>,
(thanks to [Dewey Dunnington](http://github.com/paleolimbot)) and <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/programming.html>.

I'm going to focus on ggplot2, with a dash of dplyr, 
but the same principles apply to basically any function in the tidyverse.

## Recap 

**Your turn**: Turn this code in to package. 
Use what you learned yesterday to get as much as possible of R CMD check to work. 
Copy and paste from github!

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Create a local copy of first 10 rows of mtcars data frame
# We'll come back how you should store this later
mtcars <- data.frame(
  mpg = c(21, 21, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1, 14.3, 24.4, 22.8, 19.2),
  cyl = c(6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6),
  disp = c(160, 160, 108, 258, 360, 225, 360, 146.7, 140.8, 167.6),
  hp = c(110, 110, 93, 110, 175, 105, 245, 62, 95, 123),
  drat = c(3.9, 3.9, 3.85, 3.08, 3.15, 2.76, 3.21, 3.69, 3.92, 3.92),
  wt = c(2.62, 2.875, 2.32, 3.215, 3.44, 3.46, 3.57, 3.19, 3.15, 3.44),
  qsec = c(16.46, 17.02, 18.61, 19.44, 17.02, 20.22, 15.84, 20, 22.9, 18.3),
  vs = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1),
  am = c(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
  gear = c(4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
  carb = c(4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4)
)

# cyl_plot()
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_bar(aes(cyl)) + 
  coord_flip()

# cyl_sum()
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mpg = mean(mpg))
```

**Hints:**

* `create_package("~/desktop/tidytest")`
* `use_mit_license()` / `use_gpl3_license()`
* make two functions: `cyl_plot()` and `cyl_summary()`
* make it work - remember dependency stuff (`use_something()`, and `::`)
* get check passing as cleanly as you can
* GREEN post it when done; PINK post it for problems
